# bash-dnsbl-check

## Usage
Call the script with followed by a list of IP addresses to check against several common DNSBLs.

``bash blcheck.sh 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.2 127.0.0.3``

## Don't thank me
I didn't create the inital script that this was created from, simply added some looping functionality to make it more useful for checking more than one IP address at a time.

The original is from J65nko at [http://daemonforums.org/showthread.php?t=302], as is a great overview of how the script, its usage of ``sed`` and some other fun stuff.
